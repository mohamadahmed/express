Building a simple Web-Application for Analyzing Web-Sites

The objective is to build a web-application that does some analysis of a web-page/URL.
The application should show a form with a text-field thus the user can type in the URL of the webpage being analyzed.
Additionally to form should contain a button for sending the input to the server as well as to trigger the server-side analysis process.
After processing the results should be shown to the user in terms of a simple table below to the form.
The result comprises the following information:

=> What HTML version has the document?
=> What is the page title?
=> How many headings of what level are in the document?
=> How many internal and external links are in the document? Are there any inaccessible
links and how many?
=> Did the page contain a login-form?

To run application:
=> node server.js
=>it run on port 3000: http://localhost:3000/

view:
I am executed java script template "EJS template".
It contains two file 1)urlForm.ejs 2) pageContent.ejs

public:
it contain CSS and one background image.

uncompress:
I am also sending uncompress folder which contain to have a reference.
1)server.js and style.css

The building application:
1) Install all project dependencies like express, cheerio, bodyParser, gulp to minify CSS&JS.
2) To find HTML version without document load was difficult. So I used regular expression to check if the DOCTYPE +
tag contain old way of Doctype.
3) It was unclear to me what level than I create an array to load all (h1 to h6) heading level.
4) Parse url to get host name and than check host name with website anchor tag <a> also I am checking
relative path and external link if not in hostname.
5)If the load html content from cheero has any form a iam seeting it as Form exist or form does not exist.

HTTP status:
I am setting response status according error object contain error.code and set response
Register some 4xx status code with res res.status(404);
checking error.code === "ENOTFOUND".

Gulp to minify CSS and uglify js:
I am using Gulp for optimized CSS and JavaScript.
minify CSS: run command "gulp minify-css"
uglify JS: run command  "gulp minify-js"
